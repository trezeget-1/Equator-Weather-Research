# Equator-Weather-Research

Using API requests, I'm trying to solve the answer on the question "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

On the first part of this research, I use the WeatherPy Jupyter notebook to  visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator.
To accomplish this, I make use of the OpenWeatherMap API.

On the second part of this research project, I Use jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API to plan some hypothetical vacations based my ideal weather conditions.
